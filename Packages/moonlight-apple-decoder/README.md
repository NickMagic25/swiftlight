# moonlight-apple-video

A reusable C ABI around direct asynchronous Apple VideoToolbox decoding of AV1
Main/High 8/10-bit and HEVC Main/Main10/Range Extensions, plus native asynchronous Metal decoding of
PyroWave 4:2:0/4:4:4 into retained GPU planes. The implementation lives in
`Packages/moonlight-apple-decoder` in the Swiftlight monorepo. It retains its own
SwiftPM manifest and CMake build for library consumers and validation.
Moonlight Qt is an optional consumer and
compatibility reference. The core has no FFmpeg, Moonlight, Qt, SDL or renderer
dependency. Native H.264 is not implemented.

HEVC Range Extensions and AV1 High 4:4:4 use full-resolution chroma in canonical
CoreVideo `444v`/`444f` (8-bit) or `x444`/`xf44` (10-bit) bi-planar outputs.
`mav_config.chroma_format` can infer the sequence profile or require 4:2:0/4:4:4;
a mismatched sequence or an output constraint that would downsample is rejected.
Availability depends on the device and codec profile. Before negotiating 4:4:4,
call `mav_query_profile_capability` off main: it requires hardware and decodes one
bounded representative access unit, checking actual hardware output and exact
chroma-plane dimensions. The call creates and drains a temporary session and can
block in VideoToolbox. Failures are not cached, including resource failures.
The actual stream must still produce hardware-validated output.

The embedded representative samples in [profile_samples.hpp](src/profile_samples.hpp)
are adapted from Moonlight Qt contributors under GPLv3, with the published source
revision, original/adapted SHA-256 hashes and transformations recorded in the
header. [import-profile-samples.py](scripts/import-profile-samples.py) reproduces
them from committed source. The two single-IDR HEVC 4:4:4 samples lower only the
SPS reorder declaration from two to zero; production still rejects reordering.
AV1 imports omit only terminal zero padding after parser-delimited sized OBUs.
These probes establish profile/output availability, not image quality,
throughput, live-stream or display acceptance.

## Build

Prerequisites: Apple SDK with the public AV1 declarations (Xcode 15+), CMake
3.23+, and a compiler supporting C++23 for both C++ and Objective-C++.
SwiftPM requires Swift 6.3+ and compiles Swift sources in Swift 6 language mode;
its `.cxx2b` setting selects C++23. The upgrade was validated with Xcode 26.6,
Apple Clang 21, Swift 6.3.3, and SDK 26.5.
The core supports macOS 11+, iOS/iPadOS 17+, tvOS 17+; AV1 hardware sessions are
runtime gated (macOS 14+/iOS/tvOS 17+ plus actual hardware support). These are
library targets, not a change to a consumer application's deployment target.

PyroWave comes from the pinned [fork submodule](Dependencies/pyrowave). Initialize
the monorepo submodules from the Swiftlight checkout root, then work in the
decoder package for the commands in this guide:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd Packages/moonlight-apple-decoder
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
MAV_PROFILE_HARDWARE_TESTS=1 build/mav-profile-probe
cmake --install build --prefix "$PWD/install"
```

On a machine known to support HEVC 4:4:4, add `MAV_PROFILE_REQUIRE_HEVC444=1`
to make missing 8/10-bit profile outputs fail the gate instead of reporting
device-specific unavailability. This does not change the library's runtime
capability policy.

Consumers use `find_package(MoonlightAppleVideo CONFIG REQUIRED)` then
`target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE MoonlightAppleVideo::Decoder)`.
Installed header: `moonlight_apple_video/decoder.h`.

```sh
swift build -c release
swift run -c release mav-swift-smoke
```

The Swift target imports the C Clang module; Swift C++ interoperability is not
required. See [PyroWave input, GPU ownership and validation](docs/pyrowave.md),
[Swift ownership smoke](examples/swift/main.swift) and the full
ownership/concurrency contract in the public header.

See [C++23 and Swift 6.3 validation](docs/toolchain-upgrade.md) for the upgrade's
regression coverage and consumer compatibility checks.
The [resolution/frame-rate matrix](docs/toolchain-matrix.md) covers 1080p60/120,
3440x1440p120/240, and 4K60/120, including the AV1 startup-budget limitation and
its C++17 comparison. The [performance opportunities review](docs/toolchain-performance-opportunities.md)
outlines further experiments enabled by the newer toolchains.

Portable parser and mock lifecycle tests also build on Linux. Linux tests and
simulator builds never establish VideoToolbox hardware performance.

## Offline validation and benchmarks

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap-aom.sh # Local AV1 fixture encoder; not a library dependency
./scripts/validate.sh --suite correctness
./scripts/validate.sh --suite offline-hardware --require-hardware --require-codecs av1,hevc --require-variants sdr8,hdr10
./scripts/benchmark.sh --preset 1080p120-av1 --inflight 1,2,3
./scripts/benchmark.sh --preset 1080p120-hevc --inflight 1,2,3
```

See [fixture workflow](docs/fixtures.md), [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md), and
[implementation evidence](docs/implementation-report.md) for exact prerequisites,
results, and limits. Encoders run before replay, never during timing. Strict
coverage fails when a required codec/variant is unavailable. Hardware-required
session creation and actual hardware output are checked separately.

The [YAML testing framework](docs/testing-framework.md) configures resolution,
frame rate, codec, dynamic range, bitrate in Mbps, and decoder settings for local
and CI runs. The [bitrate matrix](benchmarks/bitrate-matrix.yaml) covers all six
resolution/frame-rate modes with 50, 100, 250, and 350 Mbps targets for AV1/HEVC
and SDR/HDR10 (96 cases). Requested targets and measured encoded rates are
reported separately. It compares two builds using identical fixtures and
alternating run order. Explicit-bitrate noise fixtures require full-frame
comparison against an independent software reference before timing; the optional
FFmpeg helper is a testing dependency only. Each comparison writes
human-readable `report.md`, machine-readable
`results.json`, and JUnit results alongside the raw measurements.
The [96-case Mbps validation](docs/bitrate-matrix-validation.md) preserves both
reports, measured bitrate coverage, and any delivery failures.
The [full paired toolchain comparison](docs/toolchain-paired-comparison.md)
records all requested modes, the queue-32 startup control, and balanced
confirmation of the initial latency flags.

[Latency optimization investigation](docs/optimization-investigation.md) compares
paced and saturated decode and ranks the next experiments toward the 1 ms goal.
The [isolated experiment results](docs/experiment-results.md) compare those
branches, including 4K60 SDR/HDR correctness and hardware timing, with commands
and evidence for choosing which changes to prioritize.
Main adopts the HEVC scanner and parser-state optimizations plus optional replay
pacing. See [adopted changes and combined validation](docs/main-adoption.md).
The [4K60 VT interval investigation](docs/vt-interval-investigation.md) separates
API blocking, output-format/cadence controls, and native-to-Qt handoff costs.
The [decoder-service follow-up](docs/vt-wait-dependencies.md) traces the waits
through XPC, CoreMedia semaphores and AppleAVD notifications.

## Architecture and consumer compatibility

[Architecture and lifecycle](docs/architecture.md) describes spans, AV1 temporal
units, hidden/existing-frame accounting, bounded admission, metadata, and clocks.
[Repository investigation](docs/investigation.md) records actual Qt/common-c
source paths and revisions. Qt integration materials are under
`integration/moonlight-qt`; the application keeps its existing Metal renderer.
The reusable implementation is shared by CMake and SwiftPM, not copied into Qt.
The Qt helper defaults to a `moonlight-qt` checkout beside the Swiftlight
checkout; set `MOONLIGHT_QT_DIR` when it lives elsewhere.

```sh
MOONLIGHT_QT_DIR=/path/to/moonlight-qt ./scripts/build-moonlight-qt.sh
```

Live host interoperability and presentation throughput require separate live
client tests; headless decoding alone does not establish either.

The imported reports under `docs/` record their original standalone decoder
revisions, paths and measurements. They are historical evidence. New builds and
benchmark provenance identify the Swiftlight monorepo revision. See
[import provenance](IMPORT.md) for the source revision and preserved boundaries.
