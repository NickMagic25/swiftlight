# Server-free fixtures and correctness

The production decoder has no encoder or FFmpeg dependency. The macOS `mav-fixture` tool uses `VTCompressionSession` for HEVC and the standalone AOM encoder for AV1. `mav-replay` reads complete access units and uses the installed public C API and the same native decoder linked into Moonlight Qt.

Build with an available CMake 3.23+ and Xcode macOS SDK:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel 4
./scripts/bootstrap-aom.sh
./scripts/validate.sh --suite correctness
./scripts/validate.sh --suite offline-hardware --require-hardware --require-codecs av1,hevc --require-variants sdr8,hdr10
```

`CMAKE`, `PYTHON`, `JOBS`, `AOMENC`, and `--build-dir` can select local tools. A broken version-manager shim is not an installed working CMake: set `CMAKE` to the actual executable. The bootstrap fetches AOM v3.13.3 at `92d4c37fbdd08944a0e721bbaeb13318f10aebb0` from the [AOM project](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/), builds `.local/aom-build/aomenc` and `aomdec`, and installs nothing system-wide. Network access is required once for regeneration; saved fixtures require no encoder. Run hardware tools outside an automation sandbox that denies VideoToolbox device service access; on this machine that sandbox returned `-12911`, while the identical binaries succeeded with normal hardware access.

The default hardware suite exercises both codecs and both SDR8/HDR10 variants. Explicit requirements and the `offline-hardware` suite return a nonzero status when any required coverage is missing. The ordinary `correctness` suite also runs CTest; on heterogeneous environments it can report `PARTIAL` for unavailable Apple hardware after portable tests pass. `results/validation/summary.json` always distinguishes each codec and variant. Generated payloads and raw references are local artifacts, not committed media.

Direct generation and replay:

```sh
build/mav-fixture --codec av1 --variant hdr10 --width 1920 --height 1080 --fps 120 --frames 120 --gop 60 --output fixtures/generated/example --aomenc .local/aom-build/aomenc
build/mav-replay --fixture fixtures/generated/example/manifest.json --mode correctness --loops 2 --output results/example
```

Change `av1` to `hevc` and `hdr10` to `sdr8` to cover the other variants. The test pattern has gradients, moving detail, a translating square, and sixteen high-contrast frame-ID cells. Without an explicit bitrate, AV1 uses a two-column tiled, good-quality CPU6 encode at constant quality 12. Both default and explicit bitrate encodes have zero lag, alternate-reference generation disabled, and fixed periodic keys; the parser verifies the result rather than trusting these settings. HEVC disables encoder frame reordering and uses its actual sample attachments and parameter sets to derive complete Annex-B access units.

`--bitrate-mbps` uses decimal megabits per second: `50`, `100`, `250`, and `350` request those Mbps targets; fractional values such as `12.345` are supported from 0.001 through 1000 Mbps with at most three decimal places. The tool converts the target to the native AV1 encoder's kbps or HEVC encoder's bits per second. Omitting the option preserves the existing encoder defaults. The former `--bitrate-kbps` option is rejected with migration guidance.

The target is an encoder setting, not a guarantee that a short synthetic clip reaches that average rate. Every generated manifest reports `generator.requested_bitrate_mbps`, `generator.settings.bitrate_mbps`, and `generator.measured_bitrate_mbps`; the measured rate covers encoded payload bytes, including codec and HDR headers, without transport overhead. Exact encoder settings and `measured_bitrate_bps` are also retained for verification. The [YAML testing framework](testing-framework.md) includes target and measured rates in its human-readable Markdown and machine-readable JSON reports.

Explicit bitrate targets use deterministic, independently changing luma noise below the top one-eighth frame-ID strip, with neutral chroma. This gives the encoder substantially more detail to encode than the default gradient and makes higher bitrate settings meaningful workload inputs. The source hash uses seed `0x6d617631`, coordinates, and frame number; luma stays within video range (16–235 for 8-bit, 64–940 for 10-bit). `generator.content_profile` records `seeded-noise-frame-id-v1` and `generator.content_seed` records the seed. The fixture generator retains its existing `generator.pattern` identifier; this is not a claim that the noise profile contains the default gradient or that lossy reconstruction preserves the source markers. The YAML framework requires full-frame independent software-reference validation for this profile, as described below. With no explicit bitrate, the original gradient, detail, square, and frame-ID source pixels and their marker checks are unchanged. No filler bytes or padding are used to inflate the measured rate.

For explicit AV1 targets, the encoder uses realtime CPU8 CBR with frame dropping disabled, maximum intra/inter-frame rate of 300%, undershoot/overshoot controls of 10%, and a 1000 ms buffer with 500 ms initial/optimal fullness. For explicit HEVC targets, generation uses offline `RealTime=false` with frame reordering disabled; the requested average bitrate is paired with a one-second cap at 120% of that target. The manifest records the offline setting and exact `[bytes, seconds]` pair in `encoder_settings`. Legacy HEVC generation without an explicit bitrate retains `RealTime=true`. Any encoder-dropped frame still fails preparation, with the source frame ID, status, and callback flags reported. These controls do not guarantee that a short clip reaches its target: offline HEVC can overshoot during startup even when it encodes every frame. Every case reports and checks its measured rate independently, so successful fixture preparation can still produce an inconclusive bitrate-coverage result. Noise fixtures use the framework's full-frame reference checks for both codecs and dynamic ranges. Encoder preparation and correctness validation occur before timed decoder comparisons.

Both HDR generators encode actual 10-bit 4:2:0 pixels with Main/Main10 profiles as appropriate and BT.2020/PQ signaling. The fixture tool supplies standards-defined AV1 HDR metadata OBUs or HEVC prefix SEI for a deterministic 1000-nit mastering display and MaxCLL/MaxFALL. These are compressed-stream metadata, not labels attached after decoding. VT accepted compression mastering properties but omitted some SEI on this machine; explicit fixture metadata closes that gap. AV1 MDCV RGB fixed-point units are converted to the public API's HEVC/SMPTE2086 G,B,R representation by the production parser.

## Manifest schema 1

`manifest.json` records codec, profile, framing, width/height, bit depth/chroma, rational frame rate/timebase, color metadata, encoder settings/provenance, `payload_file`, whole-payload SHA-256, and an ordered `access_units` list. Each entry includes contiguous byte offset/length, its own SHA-256, unique frame ID, nullable PTS/DTS, duration, random-access/discontinuity flags, and expected display count. Generated fixtures also record `expected_visible_frame_id`. Metadata byte arrays are base64 in the manifest. The reader checks size limits, path containment, payload hashes, duplicate IDs, bounds, framing, and a valid initial random-access point. File payloads are bounded at 2 GiB and AUs at 64 MiB; generate short clips and loop them for long tests.

The AV1 importer removes the IVF header and each IVF packet's framing; the public decoder receives only codec OBUs. HEVC converts encoder sample length prefixes and extracted VPS/SPS/PPS into Annex-B, retaining non-parameter payloads. No container is submitted to VideoToolbox.

Previously captured complete Moonlight AUs can be packed into this schema and imported using:

```sh
build/mav-fixture --import capture/manifest.json --output fixtures/imported/capture
```

The importer validates compressed syntax and expected display/random-access/format information, copies the exact payload, and preserves original timing, IDs, and expected display sequence. It does not implement transport capture, RTP, pairing, or a server.

## Independent output validation

The correctness sink checks every displayed frame's dimensions, bit depth, hardware selection, HDR metadata, IOSurface, and Y and UV Metal textures. Legacy pattern fixtures additionally check known spatial structure and visible frame ID. For noise fixtures, the YAML framework compares reconstructed pixels to a full-frame software reference instead of assuming the encoded marker survived quantization. A bounded worker owns at most 32 retained frames and never maps pixels in the VT callback. One independent retained pixel buffer is mapped after reset and destruction. `--consumer-delay-ms` delays this worker per output to exercise consumer retention; overflow is an explicit failure. Correctness mode can wait for worker capacity and its timings are not performance evidence.

A software reference decoder uses FFmpeg outside the core. Its CMake target is optional for ordinary decoder builds and legacy marker tests, and required for the YAML framework's explicit-bitrate noise fixtures. Supply an existing FFmpeg development prefix containing `include/`, `lib/`, and software AV1/HEVC decoders:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DMAV_FFMPEG_ROOT="$MOONLIGHT_QT_DIR/libs/mac"
cmake --build build --target mav-reference-decode mav-replay
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MOONLIGHT_QT_DIR/libs/mac/lib" build/mav-reference-decode --fixture fixtures/generated/example/manifest.json --output /tmp/reference.yuv
build/mav-replay --fixture fixtures/generated/example/manifest.json --mode correctness --reference-raw /tmp/reference.yuv --output results/example-reference
```

For a complete bitrate comparison, the [YAML runner](testing-framework.md#local-execution) manages this helper with `--reference-tool`, defaulting to `<fixture-build>/mav-reference-decode`. It preserves the original fixture manifest and archives a derived validation manifest that selects reference-based correctness and records the original manifest's hash. The compressed payload is unchanged. Each case gets one independent raw reference shared by the baseline and candidate correctness runs. Both must compare the exact expected number of Y/U/V samples; a missing or incomplete reference cannot pass.

Reference generation and both full-frame checks run before any timed replay. After those checks, the runner deletes the large raw reference before handling the next case, bounding scratch storage to one reference at a time. Allow at least 6 GB for a reference with the supplied modes, plus the compressed fixture archive; custom frame counts and dimensions may require more. The evidence retains the reference command, tool identity, software library version/provenance, selected runtime library path, raw hash, sample counts, and observed reconstruction errors. These records and the retained compressed fixture permit regeneration without archiving every multi-gigabyte raw file. Both `report.md` and `results.json` report the comparison, with `junit.xml` for CI. Legacy null-target marker validation is unchanged.

For a separate manual check when FFmpeg has no software AV1 decoder, use AOM on the corresponding generated `encoded.ivf`:

```sh
.local/aom-build/aomdec --i420 --rawvideo --output-bit-depth=10 -o /tmp/reference.yuv fixtures/generated/example/encoded.ivf
```

The saved IVF contains exactly the encoded picture bytes before the fixture's static HDR metadata insertion; that metadata cannot alter pixel reconstruction. This manual AOM command is not an automatic fallback in the YAML runner; provision the required software decoders for its reference helper. `--reference-raw` compares every visible Y/U/V sample from the same compressed pictures, without row padding, to planar I420 or low-bit-packed I42010 little-endian. Native P010 is shifted right by six. Tolerances are at most 2 code values for 8-bit and 8 for 10-bit; result JSON reports sample count and observed mean/max error. Reference decoding and full-plane comparison run only in correctness mode.

Fault simulation is deterministic given `--seed`, with optional `--jitter-us`, `--drop-every`, `--corrupt-every`, `--reset-every`, and `--consumer-delay-ms`. It records recovery and terminal accounting; loss triggers reset and waits for a later actual random-access AU. Additional AV1 accounting tests exercise hidden frames and `show_existing_frame` independently of the low-delay baseline.
